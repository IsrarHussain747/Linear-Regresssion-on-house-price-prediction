Project Report: House Price Prediction Using Linear and Polynomial Regression

1. Introduction
Predicting house prices is a fundamental problem in real estate and economics. This project aims to build predictive models using Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression to estimate house prices based on various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, tax rates, and other socioeconomic factors. The dataset used for this study is a structured housing dataset containing multiple features affecting house prices.

2. Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple features that influence housing prices. The features and the target variable are:

CRIM: Crime rate per capita

ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots

INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town

CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river, 0 otherwise)

NOX: Nitrogen oxide concentration

RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling

AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940

DIS: Weighted distances to employment centers

RAD: Accessibility index to radial highways

TAX: Property tax rate per $10,000

PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio

B: Proportion of Black residents

LSTAT: Percentage of lower-status population

Price: Median value of owner-occupied homes (target variable)

3. Methodology

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and split into features (X) and the target variable (y). The dataset is then divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.

Linear Regression Model: A simple linear regression model is trained using the training dataset and then evaluated on the test dataset.

Polynomial Regression Model: A polynomial regression model of degree 2 is trained using a pipeline that includes polynomial feature expansion followed by linear regression.

Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (ℝ²) score.

4. Results and Discussion

Linear Regression Performance:

MAE: 3.19

MSE: 20.52

R²: 0.68

Polynomial Regression (Degree=2) Performance:

MAE: 2.81

MSE: 15.72

R²: 0.78

The results indicate that polynomial regression provides a better fit than linear regression, as evidenced by the lower MAE and MSE, and the higher R² score. However, higher-degree polynomials may lead to overfitting, making generalization difficult on unseen data.

5. Visualization
A scatter plot comparing actual and predicted prices shows that polynomial regression predictions are closer to the actual values compared to linear regression.

6. Conclusion
The study demonstrates that polynomial regression outperforms linear regression for predicting house prices. Future work could include hyperparameter tuning, incorporating feature engineering, or using advanced machine learning models like decision trees or neural networks to further enhance predictive performance.
